# Blackhat AI — Companion Code Repository

This repository contains the companion code for the book **_Blackhat AI_**, which explores how artificial intelligence can be applied to **offensive security testing, red teaming, and adversarial simulation**.

The code in this repository is organized **by chapter**, with each chapter building on shared architectural concepts introduced earlier in the book.

This repository is intended to:
- make every code listing in the book easy to find
- provide runnable examples where appropriate
- support experimentation and extension by readers
